/*
 * We put all the example blocks in a single place, since doxygen doesn't do

 */

/**
 * \example SimpleSolve.cpp
 *
 * Shows how to create an Amesos2 solver using the Amesos::Factory interface,
 * then solve a system.
 */

/**
 * \example SimpleSolve_File.cpp
 *
 * Shows how you could use Amesos2 with Tpetra's matrix I/O functionality.
 */

/**
 * \example SimpleSolve_WithParameters.cpp
 *
 * An example of how to set solver parameters with the Superlu interface.
 */

/**
 * \example MultipleSolves_File.cpp
 *
 * This example gives an example of how to re-solve a system after having
 * changed it, either changing the matrix itself, or changing part of the RHS.
